# particle

a content-addressed node. identity = [[Hemera]] hash of content. 32 raw bytes, no headers, no version prefix. one hash function, one address space, permanent

the address is the identity. `Hemera(content)` — that is the particle. no registration, no authority, no namespace collision. two agents on opposite sides of the planet hashing the same content produce the same address. the first [[cyberlink]] to that address brings the particle into the [[cybergraph]]. a naked hash with no links never enters the graph (axiom A4)

## Hemera

```
Hemera = Poseidon2(
  p  = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1     Goldilocks field
  d  = 7                   full-round S-box: x -> x^7
  partial S-box            x -> x^-1 (field inversion)
  t  = 16                  state width (elements)
  Rf = 8                   full rounds (4 + 4)
  Rp = 16                  partial rounds
  r  = 8                   rate (elements; 56 bytes in per block, 7 B/element)
  c  = 8                   capacity (64 bytes)
  out = 4 elements          32 bytes out
)
```

every parameter is a power of 2. the [[Goldilocks field]] gives native 64-bit CPU arithmetic — a field multiplication is a single instruction. the S-box exponent $d = 7$ is the minimum invertible exponent for this field ($\gcd(7, p-1) = 1$; both 3 and 5 divide $p-1$)

capacity 8 (8 elements, 512 bits) bounds generic attacks on the sponge; collision resistance is set by the output length, not the capacity. a $b$-bit digest gives $b/2$-bit classical (birthday) and about $b/3$-bit quantum (BHT) collision resistance: the 32-byte (4-element) output above gives 128-bit classical and ~85-bit quantum (the hash row of `zheng/specs/soundness.md`); a 64-byte digest would give 256 and ~170. hemera profile v2 ([hemera#15](https://github.com/cyberia-to/hemera/pull/15)) proposes the longer identity digest for post-quantum collision resistance; Merkle nodes inside a proof stay 32 bytes. the block above mirrors [[hemera]] 0.3, which is normative. its algebraic degree is specified in [[hemera]] (the S-box and round structure live there, not here). production systems use capacity 4 (128-bit) because their hashes are ephemeral — trace commitments that live seconds. particle addresses live decades. the parameter choice matches the lifetime

one mode only: sponge. no compression mode. two modes producing the same 32-byte output from different inputs would break the address space as a function

```
initialize:  state <- [0; 16]
absorb:      for each 8-element chunk of padded input:
               state[0..8] ^= chunk
               state <- permute(state)
squeeze:     output <- state[0..8]
```

round constants are self-bootstrapping: Hemera generates its own constants from the seed `"cyber"` (5 bytes) through the zero-constant permutation. no foreign primitives in the dependency chain

see [[hemera/spec]] for the full decision record

## tree structure

large content splits into 4 KB chunks — OS page aligned, L1 cache fit, ⌈4096/56⌉ = 74 absorb blocks per leaf

```
leaf:          Hemera(chunk_bytes)
internal node: Hemera(left_id || right_id)    64 bytes in (one rate block), 32 bytes out
tree shape:    binary, left-balanced
particle:      root hash of the tree
```

left-balanced means the same content prefix always produces the same left subtree. streaming: buffer at most 4 KB + proof per step. deduplication: 4 KB blocks show meaningful repetition in real data. overhead: 1.6% tree metadata

a single chunk (<=4 KB) hashes directly — no tree, just `Hemera(content)`. the particle address is the same whether content is 10 bytes or 10 gigabytes: always 32 bytes, always a Hemera output

## domain separation

different uses of Hemera are separated at the input:

| prefix | domain |
|--------|--------|
| (none) | particle content addressing — bare content in, address out |
| `0x01` | edge hashing |
| `0x02` | record commitments |
| `0x03` | nullifier derivation |
| `0x04` | Merkle internal nodes (NMT, MMR) |

`H_edge(x) = Hemera(0x01 || x)`. particle content addressing uses no prefix — the particle address space is the default. proof-system prefixes (Fiat-Shamir, transcript binding) belong to [[zheng]]/[[lens]], not the particle domain; the full prefix registry is in [[hemera]].

## output format

```
IPFS CIDv1:  <version><multicodec><multihash><length><digest>   36-69 bytes
particle:     <digest>                                          32 bytes
```

inside the protocol, the 32-byte digest is the complete identifier. IPFS compatibility is a thin translation layer at the gateway — inside [[nox]], the wrapper never exists

all identities live in one flat 32-byte namespace: [[particles]], edges, [[neurons]], commitments, nullifiers. no type tags in the address. the type is determined by where the address appears in the [[BBG]] structure

## endofunction

`Hemera(Hemera(x) || Hemera(y))` type-checks: 32 bytes in one side, 32 bytes the other, 32 bytes out. hash of hashes is a hash. this closure under composition is why Merkle trees, polynomial commitments, and recursive proofs all use the same function without conversion

## permanence

| property | zkVM (SP1, RISC Zero) | cyber |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| hash lifetime | seconds to hours | decades to permanent |
| parameter update | software release | impossible without rehash |
| rehash cost | zero (ephemeral) | $O(10^{15})$ operations |
| cost of parameter error | reissue proofs | lose the graph |

if Hemera is ever broken: full graph rehash under a new primitive. no version byte, no algorithm agility, no graceful coexistence. one graph, one hash, one identity. storage proofs make this possible — they guarantee content availability for rehashing and must be operational before genesis

## performance

| metric | Hemera | SHA-256 |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| hash rate (single core) | ~62 MB/s | ~200 MB/s |
| zheng (CCS) constraints per hash | ~1,200 | ~25,000 |
| particles per second (200 B avg) | ~310K | — |

20x cheaper in proofs than SHA-256. 0.6x the raw throughput. the tradeoff: particle addresses are verified far more often than they are created. optimizing for proof cost is optimizing for the common case
