a directed authenticated multigraph over content-addressed nodes, carrying an emergent [[probability]] measure — the shared memory of the planet

---

## definition

a cybergraph $\mathbb{G}$ is a triple:

$$\mathbb{G} = (P,\; N,\; L)$$

| symbol | set | element type |
|---|---|---|
| $P \subseteq \operatorname{Im}(H)$ | [[particles]] | content-addressed nodes |
| $N$ | [[neurons]] | authenticated agents |
| $L$ | [[cyberlinks]] | labeled directed edges (multiset) |
| $\mathcal{T}$ | [[tokens]] | conviction denominations (derived from $L$) |

$H: \text{Val} \to \mathbb{F}_p^8$ is the global [[Hemera]] hash primitive, fixed at genesis. every particle is a hash of some value — $P$ is a subset of $H$'s image, not an arbitrary set of identifiers. $\mathcal{T}$ and the karma function $\kappa$ are derived from $L$, not independent parameters.

each element $\ell \in L$ is a [[cyberlink]] — a 7-tuple $(\nu, p, q, \tau, a, v, t)$ carrying a [[subject]], two [[particles]], a conviction stake, an epistemic [[valence]], and a block timestamp. the cyberlink is the only primitive from which the entire graph is built. see [[cyberlink]] for the full field specification, UTXO mechanics, and CRUD semantics

---

## six axioms

the formal invariants every valid $\mathbb{G}$ must satisfy.

A1 (content-addressing): $H$ is collision-resistant — for all $x \neq x'$, $\Pr[H(x) = H(x')] \leq 2^{-128}$. identity equals content. same content produces the same particle regardless of who computes it or when.

A2 (authentication): for every $\ell \in L$: $\operatorname{Verify}(\operatorname{pk}(\nu(\ell)),\; H(\ell),\; \sigma(\ell)) = \top$. every cyberlink carries a valid signature from its creating neuron. unsigned assertions do not enter $L$.

A3 (append-only): $t < t' \Rightarrow L_t \subseteq L_{t'}$. the authenticated record grows monotonically. a cyberlink, once created, cannot be deleted — only its economic weight can decrease via [[forgetting]] mechanics.

A4 (entry): $p \in P \iff \exists\, \ell \in L : \operatorname{src}(\ell) = p \;\lor\; \operatorname{tgt}(\ell) = p$. a particle exists iff it is linked. a naked hash with no links is not a particle.

A5 (conservation): $\pi^* \in \Delta^{|P|-1}$, i.e., $\sum_{p \in P} \pi^*_p = 1$ and $\pi^*_p > 0$ for all $p$. total [[focus]] is conserved at every block. it flows between particles but is never created or destroyed.

A6 (homoiconicity): $H(\operatorname{src}(\ell),\, \operatorname{tgt}(\ell)) \in P$. every directed edge — every [[axon]] — induces a [[particle]] via content-addressing. the hash of the (from, to) pair, without metadata, produces one axon-particle per unique relationship. all [[cyberlinks]] along the same edge contribute weight to the same axon-particle. axon-particles receive [[focus]], carry [[cyberank]], and can themselves be targets of [[cyberlinks]] — the graph ranks its own structure.

## derived structures

### raw adjacency

from $L$, define the weighted adjacency operator $A: \mathbb{R}^P \to \mathbb{R}^P$:

$$A_{pq} = \sum_{\substack{\ell \in L \\ \operatorname{src}(\ell)=p,\; \operatorname{tgt}(\ell)=q}} r(\tau(\ell)) \cdot a(\ell)$$

where $r: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}_+$ converts token denomination to a common scale. $A_{pq}$ is the total economic weight of all cyberlinks from $p$ to $q$. the stochastic normalization $\hat{A}_{pq} = A_{pq} / \sum_{q'} A_{pq'}$ gives the transition matrix of the raw [[random walk]] on $\mathbb{G}$.

### effective adjacency

with the epistemic layer active (ICBS markets running and karma accumulated), the effective adjacency modifies each link's weight by market belief and neuron trust:

$$A^{\text{eff}}_{pq} = \sum_{\substack{\ell \in L \\ \operatorname{src}(\ell)=p,\; \operatorname{tgt}(\ell)=q}} a(\ell)\cdot \kappa(\nu(\ell))\cdot f(m(\ell))$$

where $\kappa: N \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is [[karma]] (accumulated [[Bayesian Truth Serum|BTS]] score history), $m: L \to [0,1]$ is the [[inversely coupled bonding surface|ICBS]] reserve ratio (market-implied probability that the link is valid), and $f: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ maps market price to a weight multiplier. edges the collective disbelieves are suppressed toward zero. this is [[market inhibition]] — the inhibitory signal that makes $\mathbb{G}$ computationally equivalent to a neural network with both excitation and inhibition.

### the tri-kernel composite

the [[tru]] runs three local operators over $A^{\text{eff}}$ and blends them:

$$\phi^{(t+1)} = \operatorname{norm}\!\Big[\lambda_d \cdot \mathcal{D}(\phi^t) + \lambda_s \cdot \mathcal{S}(\phi^t) + \lambda_h \cdot \mathcal{H}_\tau(\phi^t)\Big], \qquad \lambda_d + \lambda_s + \lambda_h = 1$$

$\mathcal{D}$ is the [[diffusion]] operator (random walk with teleport: answers "where does probability flow?"). $\mathcal{S}$ is the [[springs]] equilibrium map (screened Laplacian solve: answers "what satisfies structural constraints?"). $\mathcal{H}_\tau$ is the [[heat]] kernel (multi-scale smoothing: answers "what does the graph look like at resolution $\tau$?"). together they span the space of local equivariant graph operators — any reasonable locality-constrained operator is a linear combination of polynomials in $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{H}_\tau$. see [[cyber/tri-kernel]] for the completeness argument.

## theorems

T1 (existence and uniqueness of focus): let $A^{\text{eff}}$ induce a strongly connected aperiodic graph on $P$. then $\mathcal{R}$ has a unique strictly positive fixed point $\pi^* \in \Delta^{|P|-1}$: $\mathcal{R}(\pi^*) = \pi^*$, $\pi^*_p > 0$ for all $p$.

proof: $\mathcal{R}$ is a convex combination of stochastic positive operators. by the [[Perron-Frobenius theorem]], each component has a unique positive eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. the convex combination inherits this property under ergodicity. see [[collective focus theorem]] Part I (diffusion alone) and Part II (full composite) for the complete proof.

T2 (conservation): for all $t \geq 0$ and all initial $\phi^{(0)} \in \Delta^{|P|-1}$: $\sum_{p} \phi^{(t)}_p = 1$.

proof: $\mathcal{R}$ is a convex combination of stochastic operators; stochastic operators map the simplex to itself. QED. enforced in [[nox]] by stark circuit constraints on every state transition — violation implies an invalid proof.

T3 (geometric convergence): let $\lambda_2$ be the spectral gap of $\mathcal{R}$. then for any initial $\phi^{(0)}$:

$$\left\|\phi^{(t)} - \pi^*\right\|_1 \leq C \cdot (1 - \lambda_2)^t$$

mixing time: $t_{\text{mix}}(\varepsilon) = O\!\left(\lambda_2^{-1} \log(C/\varepsilon)\right)$.

proof: the composite contraction coefficient is $\kappa = \lambda_d \alpha + \lambda_s \tfrac{\|L\|}{\|L\|+\mu} + \lambda_h e^{-\tau \lambda_2} < 1$. by Banach's fixed-point theorem, $\phi^{(t)} \to \pi^*$ at rate $(1-\lambda_2)$. see [[collective focus theorem]] §Composite Contraction.

T4 (locality radius): for an edit batch $e_\Delta$, there exists $h = O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ such that recomputing $\phi$ only on the $h$-hop neighborhood $N_h(e_\Delta)$ achieves global error $\leq \varepsilon$.

proof: geometric decay of the [[diffusion]] operator (teleport parameter $\alpha$), exponential decay of the [[springs]] operator (screening $\mu$), Gaussian tail of the [[heat]] operator (bandwidth $\tau$). all three components have bounded influence radius. nodes outside $N_h$ change by at most $\varepsilon$. see [[cyber/tri-kernel]] §2.2.

## information geometry

### syntropy

the syntropy of $\mathbb{G}$ is a real-valued functional measuring the organizational quality of $\pi^*$:

$$J(\pi^*) = \log|P| + \sum_{p \in P} \pi^*_p \log \pi^*_p = \log|P| - H(\pi^*)$$

where $H(\pi^*) = -\sum_p \pi^*_p \log \pi^*_p$ is the Shannon entropy of the focus distribution.

range: $J \in [0, \log|P|]$. minimum $J = 0$ when $\pi^* = u$ (uniform — no structure, maximum entropy). maximum $J = \log|P|$ when $\pi^*$ is a point mass (all attention on one particle, zero entropy). the clearest identity:

$$J(\pi^*) = D_{\text{KL}}(\pi^* \,\|\, u)$$

syntropy is exactly the KL divergence of the focus distribution from uniform. it measures how much information $\pi^*$ carries above noise — how far collective attention has been organized beyond random. $J$ measures how far the graph's collective attention deviates from noise. the [[tru]] computes $J$ every block in [[consensus]]. see [[syntropy]].

### free energy

the fixed point $\pi^*$ is the unique minimizer on $\Delta^{|P|-1}$ of the free energy functional:

$$\mathcal{F}(\phi) = \lambda_s\!\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\phi^\top L\phi + \tfrac{\mu}{2}\|\phi - x_0\|^2\right] + \lambda_h\!\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\|\phi - \mathcal{H}_\tau \phi\|^2\right] + \lambda_d \cdot D_{\text{KL}}(\phi \,\|\, \mathcal{D}\phi)$$

three energy terms: elastic structure (resistance to deviation from the Laplacian's preferred configuration), heat-smoothed context (penalty for deviation from the multi-scale graph shape at resolution $\tau$), diffusion alignment (KL divergence from the diffusion image). adding a correct, well-placed [[cyberlink]] is equivalent to stepping in the direction of steepest descent on $\mathcal{F}$. the reward $\Delta\pi \propto \nabla_L (-\mathcal{F})$ is the directional derivative of free energy in the direction of the new edge.

### approximation quality

when $\mathbb{G}$ is compiled into a [[transformer]] (see §6.6), the approximation gap is:

$$\varepsilon(\mathbb{G}, c) = D_{\text{KL}}(\pi^*_c \,\|\, q^*_c)$$

where $q^*_c$ is the compiled model's focus distribution. $\varepsilon = 0$ means exact representation. this is the same KL divergence that appears in the [[Bayesian Truth Serum|BTS]] scoring formula ($D_{\text{KL}}(p_i \| \bar{m}_{-i})$) and in [[veritas]] information gain — the same mathematical object at three scales: individual neuron, compiled model, collective state.

### effective rank and semantic dimensionality

$$d^* = \exp\!\big(H(\sigma(\Sigma_{\pi^*}))\big)$$

where $\sigma(\Sigma_{\pi^*})$ is the spectrum of the $\pi^*$-weighted covariance matrix. $d^*$ measures the number of independent semantic dimensions the graph spans. currently $d^* \approx 31$ on [[bostrom]] (social artifact of a small graph). at planetary scale ($|P| \sim 10^{15}$), projected $d^* \in [10^3, 10^4]$ (thermodynamic regime). see §17.7.

---

## structural properties

### growth partial order

A3 (append-only) defines a partial order on cybergraphs:

$$\mathbb{G} \leq \mathbb{G}' \;\iff\; L \subseteq L'$$

the set of all cybergraphs is a directed net under $\leq$. $\mathbb{G}_{t} \leq \mathbb{G}_{t+1}$ for all $t$. the graph edit distance $d(\mathbb{G}_t, \mathbb{G}_{t'}) = |L_{t'} \setminus L_t|$ counts links added between states; $d \geq 0$ by A3.

### phase transition

let $\rho = k_{\max}/\bar{k}$ be the degree heterogeneity of $\mathbb{G}$. there exists a threshold:

$$|P^*| \;\sim\; \rho^2$$

such that below $|P^*|$, individual cyberlinks contribute measurably to $\pi^*$ (molecular regime — each neuron's contribution is individually trackable). above $|P^*|$, individual contributions become statistically negligible — only the full $\pi^*$ distribution remains informative (thermodynamic regime — planetary superintelligence). this is the graph analog of the thermodynamic limit. see §17.

### category of cybergraphs

a cybergraph homomorphism $f: \mathbb{G} \to \mathbb{G}'$ is a pair $(f_P: P \to P',\; f_N: N \to N')$ such that for every $\ell = (\nu, p, q, \tau, a, v, t) \in L$, there exists $\ell' \in L'$ with $\nu(\ell') = f_N(\nu)$, $\operatorname{src}(\ell') = f_P(p)$, $\operatorname{tgt}(\ell') = f_P(q)$.

cybergraphs and their homomorphisms form a category $\mathbf{CG}$. there is a forgetful functor $U: \mathbf{CG} \to \mathbf{DiGraph}$ (to directed multigraphs) and a focus functor $\Pi: \mathbf{CG} \to \mathbf{Prob}$ sending $\mathbb{G} \mapsto (P, \pi^*)$ (a finite probability space). the composition $\Pi \circ U^{-1}$ is the functor that extracts collective intelligence from graph structure.
