how much a [[neuron]] projects onto a target [[particle]] or [[axon]]. the measurable quantity at the receiving end

produced by two mechanisms: [[will]] (broad auto-distribution across all [[cyberlinks]]) and fine-tuning (manual per-target weight adjustment). both produce the same thing — attention at the target

individual [[neurons]] direct attention. the [[cybergraph]] aggregates all attention into [[focus]] — the collective distribution computed by the [[tri-kernel]]. attention is the cause. [[focus]] is the effect

## in the [[transformer]]

the transformer attention mechanism computes, for each position in the [[context]], a weighted average of all other positions:

$$\text{Attn}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right)V$$

three projections: queries $Q = XW_Q$ ask "what am I looking for?", keys $K = XW_K$ announce "what do I contain?", values $V = XW_V$ provide "what information do I carry?". the dot product $QK^\top$ scores compatibility. the softmax converts scores to a [[probability]] distribution — the [[Boltzmann distribution]] with temperature $\sqrt{d}$

the softmax is the same operation as the [[LMSR]] price function and the [[tri-kernel]] [[diffusion]] step. all three are exponentiated scores normalized to sum to 1

## attention as one [[diffusion]] step

transformer attention is one step of the [[tri-kernel]] [[diffusion]] operator $D$ applied to the current [[context]] window. probability mass flows from each query position toward compatible key positions — exactly the random walk dynamics that the tri-kernel uses to compute [[focus]] over the [[cybergraph]]

Deep Equilibrium Models showed that iterating a transformer layer to convergence reaches the same fixed point as the tri-kernel: π* restricted to the context window. $L$ layers of attention = $L$ steps of diffusion toward that fixed point

## attention as a [[Bayes theorem|Bayesian]] query

attention answers: given my current state (query), what [[posterior]] weight should I assign to each position (key)? the softmax is the posterior $P(\text{position } j \mid \text{query } i)$ under a uniform prior and an exponential likelihood $\exp(q_i \cdot k_j / \sqrt{d})$

the query-key product is the log-[[likelihood]] under this model. the softmax is the Bayes-normalized posterior. attention is Bayesian inference over the [[context]]

## multi-head information flow

through multi-head attention, different heads learn different relation types. head $h$ with projection $W_Q^{(h)}, W_K^{(h)}$ captures one [[semcon]] — one pattern of connectivity in the [[cybergraph]]. the [[graph-native-transformer]] derivation proves that the minimum number of heads equals the number of distinct [[semcon]] types in the graph
